## Introduction 

The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with full TCP/IP stack and microcontroller capability. The DHT11 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. Together, they are a perfect pair for IoT projects where monitoring environmental conditions is crucial.

This repository will guide you through setting up your ESP8266, connecting the DHT11 sensor, and creating projects that monitor and share environmental data over the internet.
